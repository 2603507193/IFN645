    "This practical note introduces you to predictive modelling using Decision Tree in Python. A decision tree is relatively simple model, yet it can be powerful and accurate if built and utilised properly. The decision tree model will help to classify the lapsing donors based on their responses to greeting card mailing conducted by the national veteran organisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive modelling, including decision trees, start with a training data set. Observations in a training data set are known as *training cases/samples/rows/instances/records*. The variables are called *inputs* (or *variables/attributes/columns/features/explanatory variables or independent variables*) and *targets* (or *response/outcome/output/class/dependent variables*). For a given case, input variables are used to estimate target variable. As you learned in practical 2, measurement type/role for inputs and target can be varied as the underlying problem requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the lecture, there are two types of predictive modelling, classification and regression. Classification modelling aims to predict class labels (categorical/binary target), such as eligibility of clients for a loan (YES/NO - binary) or topic of a news article (sports, politics, entertainment - multi-class categorical). Regression aims to predict numerical/continous variable, such as age (1-100) or house price (\\$\\$\\$). We will be building predictive models to predict TARGETB, which is a binary variable, thus this practical task will introduce you to classification task.\n",

    "### 2.1. Data partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall back to the lecture. In predictive modelling, there are 3 common steps taken:\n",
    "1. Model construction/training/learning\n",
    "2. Model evaluation/testing\n",
    "3. Model usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct and evaluate models, we require 3 data partitions: training, validation and test dataset.\n",
    "* **Training dataset** is a set of examples that is used to build the model. Once the models are built, we need to know how good they are.\n",
    "* **Validation dataset** is a set of examples that is used to evaluate the performance of a model. Validation dataset is unseen (not used in training/fitting process) and typically has similar distribution with training dataset. Validation dataset is commonly used to estimate performance and choose one of a number of different models. The combined performance on training and validation sets also reveal if the learned model is **overfit** to the training dataset. In other words, it reveals if the model has learnt relationships specific to the provided data which might not be true in general. Overfitting model tends to perform horribly outside of the training set. We will see the example of overfitting in this practical note.\n",
    "* **Test dataset** is a set of examples used to estimate the performance of a model in practice. Similar to validation, test dataset is unseen. However, it is not used in model selection process.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common problem with using validation dataset is we drastically reduce the number of samples for training the model. In addition, random split used for train/validation can impact the model selected during training process. To solve this problem, k-fold cross-validation (k-fold CV) is commonly used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In k-fold cross-validation, an exclusive validation dataset is no longer required. Instead, the training dataset is randomly partitioned into $k$ equal-sized partitions. Of the $k$ subsamples, a single subsample is retained as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining $k-1$ subsamples are used as training data. The cross-validation process is then repeated $k$ times (the folds), with each of the $k$ subsamples used exactly once as the validation data. The $k$ results from the folds can then be averaged (or otherwise combined) to produce a single estimation of model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Visualisation of $k$-fold cross validation](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*J2B_bcbd1-s1kpWOu_FZrg.png)\n",
    "*Visualisation of $k$-fold cross validation - credit to Adi Bronhstein*\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation allows the validation process to generalise better (does not depend on randomness of the train/validation split) and reduces data waste (very beneficial for limited size datasets). The drawback of CV is the computation can be expensive and slow as it multiplies the model training time by $k$ times. We will learn more about CV later in this tutorial through the usage of GridSearchCV.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical, we will implement cross validation method. Firstly, we need to split the dataset into train and test set. In `sklearn`, this is commonly done using `train_test_split` function from `sklearn.model_selection`."

We will use random seed of 10 in all practicals in this unit. In practice, you can use any integer number as long as it is consistent.\n",
    "\n",

    "> In computer science, random seed (supplied to `random_state` hyperparameter in sklearn functions) is a number used to initialise pseudo-random number generator.

A consistent random seed ensures the results of running an algorithm consistent along multiple runs"

Grid search creates combinations of these two parameters (3x3 = 9 possible combinations), build models with these parameter combinations, evaluate the performance on **validation** dataset and choose the one that perform the best.\n",
